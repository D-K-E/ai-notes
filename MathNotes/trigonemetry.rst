Chapter 1: Measurement of angles
==================================

Angles are measured in terms of right angle: 

- **Degree** is a unit of right angle which is divided into 90 equal parts.

- **Minute** is a unit of degree which is divided into 60 equal parts

- **Second** is a unit of minute which is divided into 60 equal parts

So :math:`46Â°23'39''` reads as 46 degrees 23 minutes 39 seconds.

This system is called **Sexagesimal** system of measurement. This system is
widely used in practical applications of trigonometry.

There is also another **Centesimal** system which divides right angle into 100
parts each called **grade** then each grade is divided into 100 parts called
minutes and each minute is divided into 100 parts called seconds.

There is also a third system **Circular** measurement. This system is used in
higher branches of mathematics.

It is preferred in higher branches of mathematics because there is no
arbitrary number such as 90 or 360 in its definition.

Let's take any circle centered on point O, and let's pick two points on the
perimeter of this circle A and P. The angle AOP is called a radian. How do we
obtain and ensure the constancy of this angle ?

Let's suppose that there are two circles with a common center O.

Let's suppose n lines going from O to the outer circle. n lines intersect the
outer circle at points *A, B, C, D, E, F, ...*. These lines intersect the inner
circle at points *a, b, c, d, e, f, ...*.

Let's join point *a* to *b*, *b* to *c* etc, as well as *A* to *B*, etc.

Since the angle BOA is the same for sides *ab* and *AB* and :math:`aO = bO`
and :math:`AO = BO`.
