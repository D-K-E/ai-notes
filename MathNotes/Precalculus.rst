Arithmatic Operator
###################

Addition
=========

Mostly used with infix operator :math:`+`. When two or more disjoint sets
combined the number of elements in the resulting set are represented with
addition.

Properties
----------

Commutative: a + b = b + a, meaning order of elements does not change result

Associative: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c meaning the precedence of operations
does not change the final result

0 as identity element: a + 0 = a, meaning that 0 is a number which does not
change the identity of the element.

Units: in the operation a + b we assume that a and b have the same units, for
example 4m + 5m = 9m but 4m + 5m^2 is not possible.

Subtraction
============

It is usually designated with the infix operator :math:`-`.
It represents going back some steps in the number line.

Properties
-----------

Anticommutative: a - b = - ( b - a) the result is the negative of the original
result

Non associative: a - (b - c) \not = (a - b) - c the precedence of operations
contributes to the result


Multiplication
==============

Usually designated by the infix operator :math:`×` or
:math:`\cdot`. It can be thought of as a repeated addition.

Properties
----------

Commutative: a × b = b × a

Associative: a × (b × c) = (a × b) × c

Distributive: a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c

Identity element: a × 1 = a

Special case of 0: a × 0 = 0

Negation: -1 × a = -a that is multiplication with -1 results in additive
inverse

Inverse element: every number except 0 has an multiplicative inverse so that 
a × 1/a = 1 

Order preservation: multiplication by positive number conserves order, by a
negative number reverses order:
a × b < a × c if b < c
-a × b > -a × c if b < c

Division
========

Usually designated by the infix operator :math:`/`, and :math:`÷`. It can be
considered the process of calculating how many times a number is contained in
another one.

Properties
-----------

Distributive: (a+b) / c = a/c + b/c


Exponentiation
===============

It is usually designated with a base and power part as in :math:`b^n` where b
is base and n is power. It represents the repeated multiplication of base like 
:math:`b^n = b × b × ... n times ... × b`

Properties
----------

b^1 = b
b^{n+1} = b^n × b
b^{n+m} = b^n × b^m
b^0 = 1
b^{-n} = 1 / b^n
(b^m)^n = b^{m×n}
(b×c)^n = b^n × c^n
b^{u/v} = (b^u)^{1/v} = :math:`\sqrt[v]{b^u}` vth root of b^u

roots are thus treated as taking exponent with fraction


Logarithms
===========

Logarithm is the inverse of exponential function. 
For b^y = x, log_b(x) = y, basically I have the base and the resulting value I
try to find the power.

Properties
-----------

log_b(a × c) = log_b(a) + log_b(c)
log_b(x / y ) = log_b(x) - log_b(y)
log_b(x^p) = p log_b(x)
log_b(\sqrt[p]{x}) = log_b(x) / p
log_b(x) = log_k(x) / log_k(b)
