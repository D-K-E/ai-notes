let $S \subset R^n$ and $x \in R^n$, the translation of S to x is the set of
points: $ \{ x + y | y \in S \} $

Parametric representation of a point in $S \subset R^n$ is a vector of
functions, such as:
$x = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)^T 
   = (f_1(a_1, \dots, a_r), \dots, f_n(a_1, \dots, a_r) ) $

With no constraints the points in S can take any real number. We can also
introduce constraints on functions to determine the points in S, so something
like the following is possible:

$S = \{
(f_1(a_1, \dots, a_r), \dots, f_n(a_1, \dots, a_r) )_j | 
    j \in \{1,\dots, n \},
    a \in C(a) \}$
where $C(a)$ represents a subset of $R^n$ that satisfies a set of constraints.

A line in N dimensions is:
$ x = a + \alpha b$ where $a, b \in R^n$ and $b \not = 0$ meaning that at least
one component of the vector b must be a non zero value.
Notice that it has single parameter $\alpha$ which can take all real values
from $R$, that is, it is a scalar value that gets multiplied with each
component of the vector b.

In order to check whether a point is in a line or not

```Python

def in_line(a: List[float], 
            b: List[float], 
            alpha: float,
            x: List[float]) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if point x is in line of the equation (a + b * alpha)
    """
    check = True
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if (a[i] + b[i] * alpha) != x[i]:
            check = False
    return check
```
Check whether there is a line between two points:

```Python

def have_a_line(a: List[float], c: List[float]) -> bool:
    """
    We check if a line might exist between these two points.
    and try to obtain the parametric representation (a + b * alpha = c)
    since b = c - a in alpha 1
    """
    if a == c:
        return False
    b = [c[i] - a[i] for i in range(len(a))]
    return any(b[i] > 0 for i in range(len(b)))
```

Two parametric representations of lines $U$ and $V$ in $R^n$ correspond to the
same line if the following conditions hold true:

- $U = \{ x = a + \alpha * b | \alpha \in R, a, b \in R^n, b \not = 0 \}$
- $V = \{ x = c + \beta * d | \beta \in R, c, d \in R^n, d \not = 0 \}$

- $d$ is a scalar multible of $b$
- $a - c$ is a scalar multiple of $b$

```Python

def check_parametric_same_line(a: List[float], alpha: float,
                               b: List[float],
                               c: List[float], beta: float, 
                               d: List[float]) -> bool:
    """
    Two parametric representations of lines $U$ and $V$ in $R^n$ correspond to
    the same line if the following conditions hold true:

    """
    prev = None

    # check if 'd' is a scalar multiple of 'b'
    check = True
    for i in range(len(b)):
        if prev is None:
            prev = b[i] / d[i]
        else:
            check = b[i] / d[i] == prev
    if not check:
        return check

    # check if 'a - c' is a scalar multiple of 'b'
    for i in range(len(b)):
        if prev is None:
            prev = b[i] / (a[i] - c[i])
        else:
            check = b[i] / (a[i] - c[i]) == prev
    if not check:
        return check
    return check
```

Half lines and rays in N dimension:

The parameteric representation of a half line is 
$\{ x = a + \alpha b | \alpha \ge k \}$ where 

- $b \not = 0$, 
- $a,b \in R^n$
- k is a constant value.

Notice that this includes a set of points that is a subset of line's
representation which does not impose a condition on $\alpha$
In this context:

- $a$ is the starting point of half-line
- $b$ is the direction vector of the half-line

Using this representation a half line can also be characterized as a function,
such as, 
$ x = x(\alpha) 
    = \{ x_1(\alpha), x_2(\alpha), \dots, x_n(\alpha) | \alpha \ge 0 \} $
where $ x(\alpha) = a + \alpha b $
when we say a half line begins at $a$, we assume that $\alpha = 0$ and that
$b$ is the direction vector.


A ray is a half line that starts at 0, meaning that
The parametric representation of a ray is:

$\{ x = a + \alpha b | \alpha \ge k \}$ where 

- $b \not = 0$
- $b \in R^n$
- $a = \{ 0, 0, \dots, 0 \} \in R^n $
- $k$ is a constant value


For every point that is not equal to all zeros, that is 
$p = \{p_0, p_1, \dots, p_i, \dots \} \in R^n$ where $p_i \not = 0$
there is a unique ray which can be represented as:
$\{x = \alpha p : \alpha \ge 0 \}$ $p$ here is called the direction of the
ray. Notice that the same term corresponds to direction vector in the half
line equation.

Let's us consider the following half line X:
- $ \{ x = a + \alpha b | \alpha \ge k \} $

This half line begins at $a$ meaning that $\alpha = 0$

Let's us consider the following ray Y:
- $\{ x = a + \beta b | \beta \ge k \}$, where $a = \{0, 0, \dots, 0\} \in R^n$

In this case X is parallel to Y. The point $x$ on half line that begins in $a$
is translated by $\alpha / \beta$ amount in the direction of $b$.
