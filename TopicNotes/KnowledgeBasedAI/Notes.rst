Five Fundamental Problems in AI
================================

1. Intelligent Agents have limited ressources:
   - But most ai problems are computationaly intractable.

   - How then we can make AI agents to give us real time performance on ai
     problems

2. Computation is local, but problems have global constraints:

   - How then we can make AI agents to address global problems using local
     computations (object recognition with limited data for example)

3. Computational logic is mainly deductive, but many AI problems are abductive
   or inductive in nature.

  - How can we get AI agents to address abductive or inductive problems?

4. The world is dynamic, but knowledge is limited.

   - An AI agent has to begin always with what already knows, how then an AI
     agent can address a new problem ?

5. Learning, problem solving, reasoning are complex, but explanation and
   justification add to the complexity:

  - How then can we get an ai agent to justify or explain its decisions?

Characteristics of AI Problems
=================================

1. Knowledge often arrives incrementaly

2. Problems exhibit recurring patterns

3. Problems have multiple levels of granularity

4. Many problems are computationaly intractable

5. The world is dynamic, but the knowledge is static

6. The world is open ended, but the knowledge is limited

Characteristics of AI Agents
=============================

1. AI agents have limited computing powers

2. AI agents have limited sensors

3. AI agents have limited attention

4. Computational logic is deductive, problems are inductive, abductive.

5. AI agent' s knowledge is limited with respect to the world

AI system overview
-------------------

Input: Perception - data coming from sensors
Output: Action

Operations:

- Meta cognition
- Deliberation
- Reaction

Metacognition <--> Deliberation

Reaction <--> Deliberation

Deliberation has three components:

- Reasoning: 

- Learning: 

  - Gets the right answer and stores the right answer to somewhere

  - If it gets the wrong answer then if it gets the right one,
    stores the right answer to its place

- Memory: stores what is learned

All three components interact with each other.

4 School of Thought in AI
--------------------------

Think of an xy axis. At the top of y axis there is thinking,
at the bottom of y axis there is acting.
At the right of x axis there is human like, at the left of x axis there is
optimal.

What distinguishes them ?

If we think about optimal ai agents? We are necessarily talking about an ai
agent that is good in one thing, if we think about human like ai agent, we
talk about agents that are above mediocre in most things,

We can then classify AI agents according to these axis.

AI agents that think optimally:
    - Machine learning problems are mostly treated by these type of AIs

AI agents that think like humans:
    - Semantic Web

AI agents that act optimally:
    - Airplane autopilots

AI agents that act like humans:
    - Improvisational robots: that can perhaps dance to the music you play
