1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,560
And the answer to this one
is really interesting.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,572
A is clearly not independent of
E because through C we can see

3
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:08,105
an influence of A to E.

4
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:10,690
Given B that doesn't change.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,710
A still influences C
despite the fact we know B.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,260
However if we know C,
the influence is cut off.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,500
There is no way A can
influence E if we know C.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,544
A is clearly independent of B.

9
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:27,830
They're different entry variables,
they have no incoming Rs.

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,750
&gt;&gt; But here is the caveat,
given C, A and B become dependent.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,031
&gt;&gt; So whereas initially A and
B were independent,

12
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:38,579
if you give C they become dependent.

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,040
And the reason why they become
dependent we've studied before is

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,340
the Explain away effect.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,170
If we know for example C to be true,

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,550
then knowledge of A will substantially
affect what we believe about B.

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,870
If there is two joint causes for C and

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,550
we happen to know A is true,
we will discredit cause B.

19
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,324
If we happen to know A is false we'll
increase our belief for the cause B.

20
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:09,366
There was an effect we studied
extensively in the happiness example I

21
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:10,780
gave you before.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,710
The interesting thing here is you're
facing a situation where knowledge of

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,780
a variable C renders previously
independent variables dependent.
