1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,093
So the correct answer is 0.1698

2
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:10,526
approximately.

3
00:00:10,526 --> 00:00:15,370
And to compute this,
I used the trick I've shown you before.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,551
Let me write down the running count for
cancer, and

5
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:28,033
for not cancer, as I integrate
the various multiplications in base row.

6
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:34,937
My prior for cancer was 0.01,
and for non-cancer was 0.99.

7
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:36,948
Then I get my first +, and

8
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:41,710
the probability of a plus given
that we have cancer is 0.9.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,593
And the same for lung cancer is 0.2.

10
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:49,987
So according to
the non-normalized base rule,

11
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:54,623
I now multiply these two things
together to get my non-normalized

12
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:58,680
probability of having
cancer given the plus.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,639
Since multiplication is commutative,

14
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:07,126
I can do the same thing again with
my second test result, 0.9, 0.2.

15
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:11,867
And I multiply all of these three things
together to get my non normalized

16
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,911
probability, P prime,
to be the following.

17
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,479
0.0081 if you multiply
those things together.

18
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,539
And 0.0396 if you multiply
these guys together.

19
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,560
And these are not a probability.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,315
If we add those for
the two complementary,

21
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:35,603
with cancer, non cancer, I get 0.0477.

22
00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:37,974
However, I now divide.

23
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:42,413
That is, I normalize those non
normalized probabilities over

24
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:44,920
here by this factor over here.

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,410
I actually get the correct
posterior probability.

26
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,056
P(C) given ++.

27
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:55,873
And they look as follows,
approximately 0.1698 and

28
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:59,021
approximately 0.8301.
