1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,020
Here is a challenge question to give
a taste of how how we are going to

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,460
construct and use Bayesian networks to
make inferences about new situations.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,720
The small net given here models part
of the situation where a student

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,220
was about to graduate and
applied for jobs at two companies.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,690
G represents the student,
indeed, graduated.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,550
O1 and O2 represent that the student
received a job offer from the company 1

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,430
and the company 2, respectively.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,385
Calculate the probability that the
student received an offer from company

9
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:28,505
2, given that we know that she
received and offer from company 1.
