1
00:00:00,225 --> 00:00:03,125
To answer this question,
let us add up these numbers.

2
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:08,109
[INAUDIBLE] is 1, 1, 1,
this is one incoming arc, so

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,600
it's 2, two incoming arc makes 4,

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,129
one incoming arc is 2, 2 equals 4.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:23,954
Four incoming arcs make 16,
we add all the rad numbers we get 47.
