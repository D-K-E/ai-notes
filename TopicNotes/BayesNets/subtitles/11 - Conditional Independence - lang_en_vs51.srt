00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,327
I want to use a few
words of terminology.

2
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:08,348
This again is a Bayes network
of which the hidden variable

3
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:13,382
C causes the still stochastic
test outcomes T1 and T2.

4
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:18,254
And what's really important is that
we assume not just that T1 and

5
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:20,870
T2 are identically distributed.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,520
It is the same 0.9 for
test one that I used for test two.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,060
But we also assume that they
are conditionally independent.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,110
We assumed that if God told us
whether we actually had cancer or not.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,433
If you would ask with certainty
the breakup of variable C that knowing

10
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:46,408
anything about T1 would not help
us make a statement about T2.

11
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:52,135
But differently we assumed that
the probability of T2 given C and

12
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:56,416
T1 is the same as
the probability of T2 given C.

13
00:00:56,416 --> 00:01:01,781
This is called conditional
independence which is given

14
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:06,800
the value of the cancer variable C,
if you do this for

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,760
fact than T2 would be independent of T1.

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,810
It's conditionally dependant because
independence only holds true

17
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,160
if we actually know C.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,160
And it comes out of
this diagram over here.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,160
If we look at this diagram,
if we knew the variable C over

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,150
here, then C separately causes T1 and
T2.

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,757
So as a result,
if we know C whatever over here,

22
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:41,356
it's kind of cut off, categorically
from what happens over here.

23
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:47,110
That causes these two variables
to be conditionally independent.

24
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,627
So conditional independence is
a really big thing for Bayes network.

25
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:54,838
Here's a Bayes network
where A causes B and C.

26
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:58,750
And for Bayes network of this structure,

27
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,540
we know that given A,
B and C are independent.

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,389
It's written as B condition
independent of C given A.

29
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,811
So here's a question, suppose we have
conditional independence between B and

30
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:13,950
C given A.

31
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,360
Would then imply, and that's my
question, that B and C are independent?

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,620
So, suppose we don't know A.

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,072
We don't know whether we have cancer,
for example.

34
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:30,189
Would that mean that the test results,
individually, yet still independent

35
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:34,542
of each other, even if we don't
know about the cancer situation?

36
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:35,565
Please answer yes or no.

37
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:45,009
