1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,640
And the answer is 19, so one here,
one here, one here, two here, two here.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,537
Two arrows pointing to G which makes for
four and

3
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:15,033
three arrows pointing to D,
two to the three is eight.

4
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,799
So you get 1, 2, 3, 8, 2, 2,
4, if you add those up it's 19
