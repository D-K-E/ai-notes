1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,240
The answer is 3.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,666
It takes one parameter to specify
P(A) from which we derive P(-A).

3
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:14,946
It takes two parameters to
specify P(B | A) and P(-A).

4
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:21,396
From which we can derive P(-B | A) and
P(-B | -A).

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,214
So it's a total of 3 parameters for
this Bayes' Network.
