1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,419
Now, to understand the explain away
effect, you have to compare this to

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:09,266
the probability of a raise
given that we're just happy and

3
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:12,188
we don't know anything
about the weather.

4
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:14,077
So let's do that exercise next.

5
00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:18,915
So my next quiz is what's
the probability of a raise given that

6
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:23,953
all I know is that I'm happy and
I don't know about the weather?

7
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:28,282
Now this happens to be, once again,
a pretty complicated question.

8
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:28,980
So take your time.
