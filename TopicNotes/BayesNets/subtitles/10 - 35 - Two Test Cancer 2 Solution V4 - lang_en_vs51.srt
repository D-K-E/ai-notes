1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,630
We have tried the same trick as before,
where we use exact same prior

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,658
of first plus gives
the following factors, 0.9, 0.2.

3
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:14,558
But our minus gives us
the probability 0.1 for

4
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,179
a negative test result
treatment of cancer.

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:25,170
And a 0.8 for the inverse of a negative
result of not getting cancer.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,760
You multiply those together,
you get a normalized probability.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,573
And if you now normalize by
the sum of those two things to

8
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:36,920
turn the statement to a probability,

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,578
you get 0.0009 over the sum of
those two things over here.

10
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:47,498
And this is 0.0056 for the chance

11
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:52,568
of having cancer, and 0.9943 for

12
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:57,650
the chance of being cancer-free.

13
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,720
And this adds up approximately to 1,

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,620
and therefore it's
a probability distribution.
