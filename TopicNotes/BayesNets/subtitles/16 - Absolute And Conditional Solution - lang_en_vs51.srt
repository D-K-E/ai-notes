1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,887
And the answer is,
both of them are false.

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:07,090
We already saw that conditional
independence, as shown over here,

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,703
doesn't give us absolute independence.

4
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:12,749
So, for example, this is test
number one and test number two,

5
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:14,482
you might or might not have cancer.

6
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:18,226
Our first test gives us information
about whether you have cancer or not.

7
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,809
And as a result,
you've changed our prior probability for

8
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:24,410
the second test to come in positive.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,240
That means conditional independence
does not imply absolute independence,

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,759
which renders this assumption,
here, false.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,330
And as it also turns out that if
you have absolute independence,

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,040
things might not be
conditionally independent for

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,060
reasons that can't quite explain so
far but that we will learn about next.
