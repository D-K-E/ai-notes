And here's our car network which we
discussed at the very beginning of this

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,230
unit.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,776
How many parameters do we
need to specify this network?

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:14,508
Remember, there are 16
total variables and

5
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:22,891
the naive join over those 16 will
be 2 to the 16- 1, which is 65,535.

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,880
Please write your answer
into this box over here.
