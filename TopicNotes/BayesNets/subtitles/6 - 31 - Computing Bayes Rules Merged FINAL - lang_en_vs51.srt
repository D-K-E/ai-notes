1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,220
So we just encountered our
very first Bayes network and

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,670
did a number of
interesting calculations.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,200
Let's now talk about Bayes Rule and
look into more complex base networks.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,140
I want to look at Bayes Rule again and

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,820
make an observation that
is being non-trivial.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,120
Here is Bayes Rule, and
in practice what we find is

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,620
this term here is relatively easy
to compute, it's just a product.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,530
Whereas this term is
really hard to compute.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,890
However, this term over here does not
depend on what we assume for variable A.

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,500
It's just a function of B.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,360
So suppose for

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,100
a moment we also care about the
complementary range of not A given B.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,800
For which Bayes will unfold as follows.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,640
Then we find that the normalizer
P of B is identical

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,220
whether we assume A on the left side or
not A on the left side.

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:59,290
We also know that P of A given B
plus P of not A given B must be one.

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,580
Because these are two
complimentary events.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,720
It allows us to compute Bayes
rule very differently by

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,010
basically ignoring the normalizer.

20
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,890
So here's how it goes.

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,928
You compute P of A given B and

22
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:17,261
you're going to call this prime
because it's not a real probability.

23
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:20,180
It will be just P of B
given A times P of A,

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,600
which is the normalizer to the
denominator of the expression over here.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,770
We do the same thing not A.

26
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,627
So in both cases,
we compute the posterior probability not

27
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,390
normalized while omitting
the normalizer B.

28
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,570
And then we can recover
the original probabilities

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,540
by normalizing based on
those values over here.

30
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,470
So the probability of A given B,
the actual probability,

31
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,520
is a normalizer eta times this
not normalized form over here.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,034
The same is true for
the negation of A, over here.

33
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:02,783
And eta is just the normalizer
results by adding these two values

34
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:09,190
over here together as shown over
here and dividing them by one.

35
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,860
So take a look at this for a moment.

36
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,710
What we've done is we deferred the
calculation of the normalizer over here.

37
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,920
By computing pseudo probabilities
that are non-nominalized.

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,550
This made the calculation much easier.

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,353
And returned everything we just
folded back in the normalizer based

40
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:31,164
on the resulting pseudo probabilities
and get the correct answer.

41
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:40,189
