1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,460
The reason why I gave you all this
is because I wanted to apply it now

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,530
to a slightly more complicated problem,
which is the two test cancer example.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,310
In this example, we, again,
might have our unobservable cancer c,

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,540
but now we're running two tests,
test one and test two.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,074
As before,
the prior probability of cancer is 0.01.

6
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:29,893
The probability of receiving a positive
test result for either test is 0.9.

7
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:36,388
Probability of getting a negative
result, keeping them cancer free is 0.8.

8
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:40,863
And from those we were able to
compute all the other properties.

9
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,788
I'm just going to write
them down over here.

10
00:00:42,788 --> 00:00:45,425
So take a moment to just write my notes.

11
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:49,407
Now let's assume both of my
tests come back positive.

12
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:55,263
So T1 = +, and T2 = +.

13
00:00:55,263 --> 00:01:02,630
What's the probability of cancer now,
written in short form P(C|++)?

14
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,080
I want you to tell me what that is.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,620
And this is a non trivial question.
