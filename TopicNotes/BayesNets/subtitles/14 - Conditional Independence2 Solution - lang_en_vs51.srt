1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,210
So, for this one,
we are going to apply total probability.

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:10,170
This thing over here is the same as
probability of test 2 to be positive,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,640
which I am going to abbreviate
with a + 2 over here.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,859
Condition on test 1 being positive and

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,321
me having cancer has probability
of me having cancer given

6
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:26,615
positive plus probability
of test 2 being positive

7
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:31,296
condition on positive and
me not having cancer,

8
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:38,090
times probability of me not having
cancer, given the test 1 is positive.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,420
That's the same as
the total probability.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,620
But now everything is
conditioned on + 1.

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,530
Take a moment to verify this.

12
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,200
Now here you can plug in the numbers.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,664
We already calculated this one before,
which is approximately 0.043.

14
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:02,076
And this one over here is 1 minus this,

15
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:06,365
which is 0.957 approximately.

16
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:12,077
In this now exploits conditional
independence which is given that

17
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:17,670
knowledge of a first test gives me no
more information about the second test.

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,750
It only gives me information if C was
unknown as was the case over here.

19
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,070
So we can rewrite this thing over
here as follows P of plus 2,

20
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,820
given the cancer, I can drop the plus
1 and the same is true over here.

21
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,191
This is exploiting my
conditional independence.

22
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:37,702
I knew that P of plus 1 or

23
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:45,020
plus 2 condition on C is
the same as P of plus 2.

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,400
Condition of C and test 1.

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,765
I can now read those off my table here,

26
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:57,361
there's 0.9 times 0.043 plus 0.2,

27
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:03,775
which is 1 minus 0.8 over here,
times 0.957,

28
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:09,112
which gives me approximately 0.2301.

29
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:14,610
So that says if my first
test comes in positive,

30
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,720
I expect my second test to be
positive with the probably 0.2301.

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,446
That's an increase probability to the
default probability which we calculated

32
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,960
before, which is
probability of any test.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,970
Test 2 coming as positive
before was to normalize or

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,680
Bayes rule which was 0.207.

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,482
So my first test has a 20%
chance of coming in positive,

36
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:47,676
my second test after seeing
a positive test has now an increased

37
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:51,993
probability of about 23%
of coming in positive.
