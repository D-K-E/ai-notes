1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,080
Now the answer follows the exact
same scheme as before,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,800
with S being replaced by not S.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,910
So this should be an easier question for
you to answer, P of R given H,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,830
and not S, can be inverted by
base rule to be as follows.

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,290
Once we apply base rule,
as indicated over here,

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,700
where we sort H to the left side and
R to the right side,

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,670
you can observe that this value over
here can be readily found in the table.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,320
It's actually the 0.9 over there.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,631
This value over here,
the Bayes is independent of the data

10
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:40,380
Bayes network, so it's just 0.01.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,870
And as before, we apply total
probability, the expression over here.

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,729
And we obtain of this
quotient over here,

13
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:52,598
that these two expressions are the same.

14
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:54,680
P of H given not S not R.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,013
R is the value over here.

16
00:00:57,013 --> 00:01:00,485
And the 0.99 is the compliment
of probability of R,

17
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:06,143
taken from over here and
that ends up to be 0.0833.

18
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:08,785
This will be the right answer.
