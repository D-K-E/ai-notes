1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,762
And let me talk about
a really interesting and

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:09,374
special instance of Bayes Net Reasoning
which is called explaining away.

3
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:12,915
And I'll first give you
the intuitive answer, and

4
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:15,962
then I wish you to
compute probabilities for

5
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:20,590
me that manifest the explain away
effect in Bayes Net of this type.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,513
Explaining away means that,
if we know that we are happy,

7
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:31,178
then sunny weather can explain
away the cause of happiness.

8
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:33,100
If I then also know that it's sunny,

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,460
it becomes less likely
that I received a raise.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,760
So let me put this differently, suppose
I'm a happy guy on a specific day, and

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,020
my wife asks me, Sebastian,
why are you so happy?

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,920
Is it sunny, or did you get a raise?

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,504
If she then looks outside and
sees it's sunny,

14
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:55,105
then she might explain to herself, well,
Sebastian is happy because it's sunny.

15
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:59,038
It makes it effectively,
less likely that he got a raise,

16
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:03,910
because I could already explain
this happiness by it being sunny.

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,083
If she looks outside and it's rainy,
it makes it more likely I got a raise,

18
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:13,117
because the weather can't
really explain my happiness.

19
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:18,260
In other words, if you see a certain
effect that it could be caused

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,935
by multiple causes,
seeing one of those causes can explain

21
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:27,439
away any other potential cause
of this effect over here.

22
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,254
So let me put this in numbers, and
ask you the challenging question of

23
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:37,410
what's the probability of the raise
given I'm happy, and it's sunny?
