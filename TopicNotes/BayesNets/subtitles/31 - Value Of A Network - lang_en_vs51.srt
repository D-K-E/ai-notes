1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,570
So it takes 47 numerical
probabilities to specify

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,840
the joint compared to 65,000 if
we didn't have the structure.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,440
I think this example really illustrates
the advantage of compact Bayes network

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,750
representations.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,720
Over unstructured joint representations.
