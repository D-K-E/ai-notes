1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,205
In this specific example,

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:06,900
the rule applies very, very simple.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,980
Any two variables are independent,

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,050
if they're not linked by just unknown variables.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,540
So for example, ven OB,

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,820
and everything downstream of B,

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,860
becomes independent of anything upstream of B. E is not independent of C,

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,761
conditional B, however, knowledge of B does not render A and E independent.

9
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,405
In this graph over here,

10
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,330
A and B connect to C,

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,100
and C connects to D and to E. So let me ask you,

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,395
is A independent of E?

13
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:43,435
A independent of E given B? A independent of E given C?

14
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:44,810
A independent of B?

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,000
And A independent of B given C?
