1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,200
And the answer is yes.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,130
F is independent of A. Well defined by our rules of the separation is

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,405
that F is dependent on D and A is dependent on D. But,

4
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:18,285
if you don't know D, you can't govern any dependency between A and F at all.

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,485
Now, if you do know D,

6
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:22,360
then F and A become dependent.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,580
And the reason is B and E are dependent given D. And we can

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,690
transform this back into the dependency of A

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,745
and F because B and A are dependent, and E and F are dependent.

10
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:37,690
There's an active path between A and F,

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,535
which goes across here, and here,

12
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:41,640
because D is known.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,735
Now if you know G, the same thing is true because G gives us knowledge about

14
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:48,010
D and D can be applied back to this path over here.

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,090
However, if you know H,

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,225
that's not the case.

17
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:52,310
So, H might tell us something about G,

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,585
but it doesn't tell us anything about D, and therefore,

19
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:58,450
we have no reason to close the path

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,643
between A and F. The path between A and F is still passive,

21
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:05,070
even though we have knowledge of H.
