1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,390
So we want to draw Bayes rule rapidly.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,830
We have a situation where we
have an internal variable A,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,670
like whether or not we have cancer.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,520
But we can't sense A,

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,180
instead we have a second variable
called B, which is our test.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,330
And B is observable, but A isn't.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,090
This is a classical
example of a Base network.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,130
The base network is composed
of two variables A and B.

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,210
We know the prior probability for A and

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,070
we know the conditional
A causes B whether or

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,730
not the cancer causes the test
result to be positive or not.

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,590
Although with some randomness involved.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:47,750
So we know about the probability of
B given the different values for A.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,160
And what we care about in this specific
instance is called diagnostic reasoning.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,480
Which is inverse of
the causal reasoning.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,290
Probability of A given B, or similarly,
probability of A given off B.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,540
This is our very first Bayes Network and
the graphical representation

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,700
of drawn two variables, A and
B, connected with an arrow.

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,450
Because from A to B is a graphical
representation of distribution of two

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,740
variables that specified the structure
of a and this is a probability.

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,380
And has a conditional
probability which is normal.

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,220
Now I do have a quick quiz for you.

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,690
How many parameters does it
take to specify the entire

24
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,440
joint probability between A and
B or the entire Bayes Network?

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
I'm not looking for
a structural parameters.

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,380
We look to the graph over here,
just looking for

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
the numerical parameters of
the underlying probabilities.
