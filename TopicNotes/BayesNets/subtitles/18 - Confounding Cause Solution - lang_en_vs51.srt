1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,885
The answer is surprisingly simple.

2
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:08,240
It is 0.01, but
how do you know this so fast?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,359
Well, if we look at this
Bayes Network both the sadness and

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,080
the question whether they got
a raise impact my happiness.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,240
But since I don't know anything about
the happiness there's no way that

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,260
just the weather might impact
whether I get a raise or not.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,549
In fact,
it might be independently sunny and

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,230
might independently get a raise at work.

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:41,350
There's no mechanism of which
these two things would co-occur.

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,240
Therefore the probability of
a raise given it is sunny,

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,499
is just the same as the probability of
a raise given any weather which is 0.01.
