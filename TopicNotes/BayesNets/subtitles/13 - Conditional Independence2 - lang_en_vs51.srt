00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,100
So let me draw the cancer
example again with two tests.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,797
Here's my cancer variable, and

3
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:12,530
there's two condition independent tests,
T1 and T2.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,020
And as before let me assume that
the probability of cancer is 0.01.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,360
What I want you to compute for
me Is the probability

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:30,010
of the second test to be positive if we
know that the first test was positive.

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,321
So write this into the following box.

8
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:36,019
