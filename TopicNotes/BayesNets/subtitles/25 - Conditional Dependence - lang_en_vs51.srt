1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,262
It's really interesting to compare
this to the situation over here.

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:07,387
In both cases, I'm happy,
as shown over here.

3
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:12,052
And I asked the same question,
which is whether I got a raise at work,

4
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:13,270
this R over here.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,638
But in one case,
I observe that the weather is sunny and

6
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:18,230
in the other one isn't.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,557
And look what it does to my probability
of having received a raise.

8
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:26,055
The sunniness perfectly
well explains my happiness.

9
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:31,127
And my probability of
having received a raise

10
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:36,340
ends up to be a mere 1.4%, or 0.014.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,874
However, if my wife observes it to
be not sunny, then it is much more

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:45,344
likely that the cause of my happiness
is related to a raise at work.

13
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,988
And now the probability is 8.3%,

14
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:52,043
which is significantly
higher than the 1.4% before.

15
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:56,268
Now, this is a Bayes'
network of which S and

16
00:00:56,268 --> 00:01:01,993
R are independent, but
H adds a dependence between S and R.

17
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:06,520
Let me talk about this in a little
bit more detail on the next paper.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:06,980
So here's a
