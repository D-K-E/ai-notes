1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,090
And the answer is 13.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,500
1 over here, 2 over here,
and 4 over here.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,081
Simplified this speaking,
any variable that has K

4
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:15,245
inputs requires 2 to
the K search variables.

5
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,469
So in total we have 1, 9, 13.
