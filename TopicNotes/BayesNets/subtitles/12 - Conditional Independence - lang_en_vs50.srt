1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,241
And the correct answer is no.

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:07,899
Intuitively, getting a positive
test result of what cancer

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:12,479
gives us information about
whether you have cancer or not.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,780
So if you get a positive test result,

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,277
you're going to raise
the probability of having cancer.

6
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:19,811
So relative to the prior probability.

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,694
With that increased probability,

8
00:00:22,694 --> 00:00:28,170
we will predict that another test will,
with a higher likelihood,

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,951
give us a positive response than if
we hadn't taken the previous test.

10
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,401
It's really important to understand.

11
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:41,410
So that we understand it, let me make
you calculate those probabilities.
