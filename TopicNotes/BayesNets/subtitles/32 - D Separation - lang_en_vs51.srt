The next concept I'd like to
teach you is called D-Separation.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,680
And let me start the discussion
of this concept by a quiz.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,410
We have here a base network and

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,160
then when we ask to conditional
independence question.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,302
Is C independent of A,
please tell me yes or no.

6
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:24,478
Is C independent of A given B,
is C independent of D,

7
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:30,736
is C independent of D given A, and
is E independent of C given D.
