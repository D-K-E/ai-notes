1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,719
So C is not independent of A.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,063
In fact, A influences C by virtue of B.

3
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:13,388
But if you know B,
then A becomes independent of C,

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:17,022
which means the only
determinant to C is B.

5
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:17,919
If you know B for

6
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:21,857
sure, then knowledge of A won't
really tell you anything about C.

7
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:27,606
C is also not independent of D, just
the same way C is not independent of A.

8
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:31,410
If I learn something about D,
I can infer more about C.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,980
But if I do know A, then it's hard to
imagine how knowledge of D would help

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,030
me with C because I can't learn anything
more about A than knowing A already.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,950
Therefore, given A,
C and D are independent.

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,470
The same is true for E and C.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,670
If you know D then E and
C become independent.
