1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,488
The answer is approximately 0.0142.

2
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:10,266
And as an exercise in expanding
this term using Bayes' rule,

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:14,120
using total probability,
which I just do for you.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,945
Using Bayes' rule,
you can transform this into P of H,

5
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:26,764
given R, S times P of R
given S over P of H given S.

6
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:30,488
You observe the position
independence of R and S,

7
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,540
to simplify this to just P of R.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,867
And the denominator is expanded
by folding in R and not R.

9
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:44,822
You have (H | R,S) times
P(R) plus P(H|-RS)

10
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:49,870
times P(-R) which is total probability.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,757
You can now read off the numbers
from the tables over here,

12
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:59,946
which gives us 1 times 0.01
divided by this expression is

13
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:06,058
the same as the expression over here
0.01 plus this thing over here.

14
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:10,522
Which we can find over here
to be 0.7 x this one over

15
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:15,097
here which is one minus
the value over here 0.99.

16
00:01:15,097 --> 00:01:19,752
Which gives us approximately 0.0142
