1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,282
The answer is A, 0.7445.

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:08,106
Even though the base net is simple the
answer will require a bit more work than

3
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:10,280
many of our challenge questions.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,660
To be clear we'll be using capital
letters to indicate our variables.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,010
We're using low case letters to
indicate when that variable is true,

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,510
or a non in front of it it to
indicate when its not true.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,070
To solve this problem we have to
determine the ratio of times o2

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,900
is true given o1 is true,
to all situations where just o1 is true.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,590
In other words, we sum over all possible
graduation situations, where o2 and

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,440
o1 are true for the numerator.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,470
Which is simply,
the probability of o1 being true,

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,500
o2 being true and graduation being true.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,620
Plus the probably of o1 being true, o2
being true and graduation being false.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,399
And we're going to
normalize by this number,

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,972
plus the situation where o2 is negative.

16
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:54,348
And that is the probably of o1, not o2,

17
00:00:54,348 --> 00:00:58,800
and g, plus the probably of o1,
not 02, and not g.

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,354
Looking at the first part of the
numerator, probability of o1, o2, and

19
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:07,170
g, that is simply
the probability of o1 given g,

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,945
times the probability of o2 given g,
times the probability of g.

21
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,790
And we can just read this off
the base network over here.

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,739
The first number,
the probability of o1 given g is 0.05.

23
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,584
Probability of o2 given g is just 0.75.

24
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:26,094
And the probability of g is just 0.9.

25
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:29,868
We multiply that out and it's 0.3375.

26
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:32,540
Next we'll consider the second
part of the numerator,

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,520
the probability of o1, o2, and not g.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,559
Well that's simply the probability
of 01 given not g,

29
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:42,119
the probability of 02 given not g,
and the probability of not g.

30
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,772
And again we'll just read off our chart.

31
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:49,733
It's 0.05 for
a probability of o1 given not g,

32
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:54,941
0.25, which is a probability
of 02 given not g.

33
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:59,239
And then the probability of not g,
which is just the compliment of this,

34
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,305
which is 0.1.

35
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,412
That comes out to be 0.00125.

36
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:06,550
Now we'll consider the last
two parts of the equation.

37
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,990
We already have these
two from our numerator.

38
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,469
So now we need to look at
probability of o1, not o2, and g,

39
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:17,181
which is just equal to probability of o1
given g, probability of not o2 given g,

40
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:18,510
and probability of g.

41
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,550
Again, we can just read these
numbers off our base net.

42
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,010
It comes up to be 0.1125.

43
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,150
The final one probability,
of o1, not o2 and not g.

44
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,706
Again we just use the same equations and
we get 0.00375.

45
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:36,632
Now we can take all these
numbers we have just calculated,

46
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:41,000
put it into our equation, and
do the substitution and get our answer.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,064
Doing the simple math
we end up with 0.7445,

48
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,068
which is what we were hoping for.

49
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:50,231
We calculated this answer by summing up
the results for all relevant situations.

50
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,247
But we can also do
inference by sampling,

51
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,720
which can handle much bigger networks.

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,580
Please be on the lookout for

53
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,120
all the different ways we can
do inference invasion networks.
