1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,700
So this is a difficult question.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,700
Let me compute an auxiliary label,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,580
which is P of Happiness, that one is

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,600
expanded by looking at the different
conditions that can make us happy.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,315
P of Happiness given S and
R, times P of S and

6
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:23,443
R, which is of course
the product of those two,

7
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:27,175
because independent plus P of Happiness.

8
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:32,935
Given not S R, probability of
not S R + P of H given S and

9
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:37,031
not R times the probability
of P of S and

10
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:42,289
not R plus the last case P
of H given not S and not R.

11
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,438
So this just looks at the happiness and

12
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:48,630
all four combinations of the variables
that could lead to happiness.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,660
And you can plug those straight in,
this one over here is 1.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,607
And this one over here
is the product of S and

15
00:00:56,607 --> 00:01:00,599
R which is 0.7 times 0.01.

16
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:06,078
And as you plug all of those in,
you get as a result,

17
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:09,796
0.5245, that's P(H).

18
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:14,582
Just take some time and do the math by
going through these different cases

19
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:17,495
using probability and
you get this result.

20
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:24,636
Now armed with this number,
the rest now becomes easy which is,

21
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:29,132
we can use base rule
to turn this around,

22
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:33,114
P(H given R) P(R) over P(H).

23
00:01:33,114 --> 00:01:37,719
P(R) we know from over here,
the probability of a race is 0.01.

24
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,303
So the only thing we need to
compute now is P(H given R).

25
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:45,548
And again we applied sort of probability
let me just do this over here.

26
00:01:45,548 --> 00:01:49,912
We can factor P(H given
R) as P(H given R,S) for

27
00:01:49,912 --> 00:01:54,684
sunny times probability of
sunny plus P(H given R) and

28
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:58,657
not sunny times
the probability of not sunny.

29
00:01:58,657 --> 00:02:03,883
And if you plug in the numbers for
this you get 1

30
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:11,255
times 0.7 + 0.9 times 0.3
that happens to be 0.97.

31
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:18,701
So if you now plug this all back
into this equation over here,

32
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:24,833
we get 0.97 times 0.01 / 0.5245.

33
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:31,994
This gives us approximately,
as a correct answer, 0.0185.
