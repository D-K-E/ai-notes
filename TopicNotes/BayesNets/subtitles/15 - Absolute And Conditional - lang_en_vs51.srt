1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:04,557
So now we've learned about independence
and the corresponding Bayes network has

2
00:00:04,557 --> 00:00:07,130
two nodes,
they're just not connected at all.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,379
And we learned about
conditional independence,

4
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:12,008
in which case we have a Bayes
network that looks like this.

5
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:16,896
Now I would like to know whether
absolute independence implies

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,410
conditional independence, true or false?

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,012
And I'd also like to know whether
conditional independence implies

8
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:25,386
absolute independence.

9
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:27,190
Again, true or false?
