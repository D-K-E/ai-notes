00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,940
Sebastian, why are Bayes Nets important?

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,781
&gt;&gt; They're one of the most amazing
accomplishments of recent artificial

3
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:06,910
intelligence.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,510
They take the idea of uncertainty and
probability and

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,900
marry it with efficient structures.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,155
So you don't have a big mumble jumble
but you can really understand,

7
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:20,014
like what uncertain variable
influences other uncertain variable.

8
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:25,580
A theory of the world using just
Bayes Networks is really an amazing.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
&gt;&gt; Well, I've been teaching AI for
many years, I've found that listening to

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,590
Sebastian's lessons has really given
me a better intuition for Bayes Nets.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,130
As you go through these lessons,
make sure to understand how to construct

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,080
a Bayes Nets and
how to do inference with them.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,810
One of my favorite algorithms
is Monte Carlo Markov Chain.

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,480
Have fun with the lesson.
