1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,680
For my next example, I will study
a different type of a Bayes network.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,838
Before we've seen networks
of the following type,

3
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:12,370
where a single, hidden cause
caused two different measurements.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,600
I now want to study a network that
looks just like the opposite.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,110
We have two independent,
hidden causes, but

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,060
they get confounded within a single,
observational variable.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,120
I would like to use
the example of happiness.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,080
Suppose I can be happy or unhappy.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,157
What makes me happy is
when the weather is sunny,

10
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:41,040
or if I get a raise at my job,
which means I make more money.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,601
So let's call this sunny, let's call
this a raise and call this happiness.

12
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:52,093
Perhaps, the probability
of it being sunny is 0.7.

13
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:57,279
The probability of a raise is 0.01.

14
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:03,290
And I will tell you if the probability
of being happy is governed as false.

15
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,812
The probability of being happy given
that both of these things occur,

16
00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:11,722
I got a raise and it's sunny, is 1.

17
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:16,688
The probability of being happy
given that it is not sunny and

18
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:19,376
I still got a raise, is 0.9.

19
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:23,592
The probability of being happy
given that it is sunny, but

20
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:26,185
I didn't give a raise, is 0.7.

21
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,855
And the probability of being happy,

22
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:33,774
given that it is neither sunny nor
did I get their raise, is 0.1.

23
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:39,380
This is a perfectly fine specification
of a probability distribution

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,613
where two causes affect the variable
down here, the happiness.

25
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:48,223
So I'd like you to calculate for
me the following questions.

26
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:54,950
The probability of a raise given that
it is sunny, according to this model.

27
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,900
