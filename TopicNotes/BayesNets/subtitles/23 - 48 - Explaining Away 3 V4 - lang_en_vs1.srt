1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,630
And if you got this right,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,470
I will be deeply impressed of
the fact you got this right.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,810
My happiness is well explained
by the fact that sunny.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,770
So if someone observes you to
be happy and asks the question,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,740
is this because Sebastian
got a raise at work?

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,300
Well If you know it's sunny and
this is a fairly good explanation for

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,230
me being happy.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,830
You don't have to assume I got a raise.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,508
If you don't know about the weather,

10
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:33,791
then obviously the chances are higher
that the raise caused my happiness.

11
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:39,274
And therefore this number
goes up from 0.014 to 0.018.

12
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:44,276
Let me ask you one final
question in this next quiz which

13
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:50,822
is the probability of a race given
that I look happy and it's not sunny.

14
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:55,398
This is the most extreme case for
making a raise likely because

15
00:00:55,398 --> 00:01:00,640
I am a happy guy and it's definitely
not caused by the weather.

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,300
So it could be just random or
it could be caused by the raise.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,260
So please calculate this number for
me and enter it into this box.
